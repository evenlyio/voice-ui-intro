# Starship Skill

This is a simple demo skill to demonstrate the basics of building an alexa skill. 

This is a very simple skill that demonstrates the [Alexa Skill Kit NodeJS SDK](https://github.com/alexa/alexa-skills-kit-sdk-for-nodejs). It consists of

- Skill metadata: `skill.json`
- Language Model: `model/en-US.json`
- A custom AWS Lambda function Model: `model/en-US.json`

The skill is setup with the [Alexa Skill Kit (ASK) CLI](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/smapi/quick-start-alexa-skills-kit-command-line-interface.html).

You need to have:

- NodeJS installed 
- A [Amazon Developer Account](http://developer.amazon.com)
- An [AWS Account](http://aws.amazon.com) to set up the AWS Lambda function for the skill (unless you want to self host the skill):
